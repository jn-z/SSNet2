## SSNet2 Detection on Wideband signal

## Overview

This project implemented SSNet2 for Wideband signal detection and tested on simulated datasets and actual received wideband signals. 

### Training datasets and test datasets

Relevant training data sets and test data sets will be released in the near future.

### Example Output

> *Bounding box detection result of an time frequency spectrum of broadband signal

> *Predicted heatmap of object center points on an time frequency spectrum of broadband signal

### Best Model

> *Our trained model is placed on ./snapshot_best folder

This repository was developed and tested in PyTorch 1.5.

## How to run

- Intall required dependencies as listed in [environment.yml](./environment.yml)
- Modify signal dataset directory in centernet-vanilla/dataset.py
- Run [train.py](SSNet2/train.py) for training and [predict.py](SSNet2/predict.py) for inference

Figure above shows the precision-recall curve of our final model on the validation set. Three curves represent easy, moderate, and hard objects respectively. The area under the curve is the average precision (AP).
